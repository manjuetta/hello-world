WHY
--

In Selenium webdriver, locators like xpath, css etc are used to identify and perform
operations on web page

In case these locators do not work  or hidden we can use JavaScriptExecutor to perform 
desired operation on web element

Selenium supports javaScriptExecutor. There is no need for an extra plugin or add on.

We need to import (org.openqa.selenium.JavaScriptExecutor)

WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();

why this and not

ChromDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();

Actually both works but the first is preferred because
in our scripts there can be a need to test in multiple 
browser in such cases it is better to refer the browser
object to interface, Webdriver



		SearchContext() --> parent interface (two unimplemented methods findelement(0, findelements())
		
		WebDriver() Interface implements search --> new unimplemented methods along with overridden methods from searchcontext

The above two are interfaces are being implemented by classes 

Remote webdriver extends webDriver()

ChromiumDriver extendds chromeDriver()

So if ChromeDriver class is not directly implementing from WebDriver

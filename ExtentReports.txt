Dev team actually focuses or think more
from coding point of view (they actually visualize code) 
so sometimes they doesn't focus on the requirement and
its impact.

Extent reports - HTML reporting library

//start reporter
ExtentHtmlReporter obj = new ExtentHtmlReporter("anyname.html");
 
// create extent reports and attach reporters(s)

ExtentReports extent = new ExtentReports();
extent.attachReporter(obj);

// Creates a toggle for the give test, adds all log events under it
Extent test1 = extent.createTest("Google Search Test one","this is a test to validate google search functionality");

String Projpat = System.getProperty("user.dir"); //not related to extent report

test1.log(status.INFO, "This stept shows usage of logs");

//we have status.pass, fail ,warning and others)

test1.pass("navigated to google.com");
test1.pass("pressed keyboard");
test1.info("test complete")

//important

extent.flush();

Session 1:

UNIX -- operating system created in 1960's

What is os - To communicate with hardware, a software is required and that special software is called os.

By using OS user can communicate with hardware components. Assume OS is not there then hardware is just waste.

With lot of extentions and improvements to base versio, several flavors introduced by companies (redhat, linux, ubuntu, suse)

Important characteristics of unix:

1. It is freeware
2. It is open source software - source code is open, can make 
changes to source code and name it as required say RG Unix

FOSS - Freeware and Open Source Software

LINUX IS AN OS DEVELOPED ON TOP OF UNIX

3. Multi user operating system - multiple users can 

4. Multi tasking operating systems 

5. It is user friendly. Most advanced fw of unix/linux like ubuntu Supports both CUI -- character user interface with comments from terminal and GUI - graphical user interface based'

CUI is more efficient in some cases where we need to create multiple directories (folders we call in windows)

from CUI we can create 50 directories like below

~$ mkdir dir{1..50}

In every directory can you please create 100 files? touch keyword is used to create files

~$ touch dir{1..50}/file{1..100}

6. Why to chose over windows? It is more secure than windows OS

That is why most of the servers are hosted on unix

Flovours of UNIX -- As it is open souce, multiple flavours like 
ubuntu,
RedHat, 
CentOs, 
Fedora, 
Slackware, 
Open solaries, 
Kali, 
suse linux enterprise (SLES), 
Open Suse

with enhancements to basic os

Go to distrowatch.com for list of flavours related to UNIX. for all these flavours 80-90% of functionality are same as all these are derived from basic version.

If we are familiar with one version/flavour, we can work on other flavours also.

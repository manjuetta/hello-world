1. git init

2. git remote origin "rep url"

3. git pull origin master



(create a test file and push to github. Let the file name be test.txt)



4. git status (to check if there is any un commited code)  --if there is uncommited code, the file name will be in red otherwise should be green

5. git add test.txt

(now if we check status it will say commited)

6. git commit -m "message" (git commit -a -m "message" in case of multiple files) 

7. git push origin master


(update the file)

(repeat steps 4 -7)

git remote set-url origin https://github.com/ypraghavendra/Test2-Sep-13.git

1. if we are updating file already exists on github, we don't need to use command 'git add .' since it is already staged
if there is any update in local we can just commit

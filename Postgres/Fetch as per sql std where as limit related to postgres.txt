This section helps you get started with PostgreSQL by showing you how to install PostgreSQL on Windows, Linux, and macOS. 

You also learn how to connect to PostgreSQL using the psql tool as well as how to load a sample database into the PostgreSQL for practicing.

To constrain the number of rows returned by a query, you often use the LIMIT clause. The LIMIT clause is widely used by many relational database management systems such as MySQL, H2, and HSQLDB. However, the LIMIT clause is not a SQL-standard.

To conform with the SQL standard, PostgreSQL supports the FETCH clause to retrieve a number of rows returned by a query. Note that the FETCH clause was introduced in SQL:2008.

OFFSET start { ROW | ROWS }
FETCH { FIRST | NEXT } [ row_count ] { ROW | ROWS } ONLY

SELECT
    film_id,
    title
FROM
    film
ORDER BY
    title 
FETCH FIRST ROW ONLY;

or  

SELECT
    film_id,
    title
FROM
    film
ORDER BY
    title 
FETCH FIRST 1 ROW ONLY;

or 

SELECT
    film_id,
    title
FROM
    film
ORDER BY
    title 
FETCH FIRST 5 ROW ONLY;

The following statement returns the next five films after the first five films sorted by titles:

SELECT
    film_id,
    title
FROM
    film
ORDER BY
    title 
OFFSET 5 ROWS 
FETCH FIRST 5 ROW ONLY;
